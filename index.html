    <h1>Do you love cats?<br><br></h1>
    <p1>
        I think everbody love the cuteness of these small creatures. We call them cat, the word cat suits them vey well. 
        
        You can share stories and ideas, and give and receive advice about health, problems, illnesses, products, and all things feline.
        If you are like most cat owners, you want to be the best cat lover you can be... this website can help.
        
        Now you can better understand, love, and care for your pet.
        
        Here you'll find the best growing collection of cat and kitten related information, products, and resources on the Net.
        
        I've been owned by three felines for 10 years, one of them for over 12 years. As an experienced cat owner, I've had many of the same questions that you do about caring for your cat.
        
        The answers to these questions were not always easy to find, and much of the information conflicting. The good news for you is that I've decided to put all that my little friends have taught me on this website.
        
    
        In addition, you'll find whatever new information I can get my paws on that'll help you to become one of the best informed cat lovers on the planet.
        
        I'll also try to make sense of the conflicting advice and information you see about cats out there on the web.
        
        Want to change your kitty's food, but not sure if it's the right thing to do?
        
        Looking for the best places to buy pet supplies or pet care products? Puzzled by your little furry friend's behavior?
        
        Having litter box problems? Trying to find the perfect kitten toy or gift? I've either experienced it first hand, or I'm researching it right now.
        
        I am constantly on the hunt for more stuff for cat lovers. Whatever I can find, whatever new things I discover, I'll post it on the Web for you.
        
        Cats have become the number one pet in the United States, and it's easy to see why. Domestic felines, like their wild cousins, are a fascinating mix of opposites.
        
        They retain wild traits, but can adapt to almost any living situation. Soft to the touch, but amazingly strong, they may appear lazy but are actually incredibly fast and agile. Sleeping many hours per day, they are ever patient and remain perfectly alert when hunting.
        
        And, from what I've observed, they're very misunderstood. I believe, however, there's a lot you can learn about, and a lot more you can learn from, your feline friend.</1p>
